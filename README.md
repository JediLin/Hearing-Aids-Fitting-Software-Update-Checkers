This project (\"The Checker\") contains scripts which can check hearing aids fitting software (such as Phonak Target) directly from each own update servers with APIs, so that you can easily know if there is a newer version available, and check corresponding files.

Please refer to [currently supported software list](SUPPORTED.md) and [latest checked results](https://github.com/JediLin/Hearing-Aids-Fitting-Software-Update-Checkers/wiki/Versions).

## Download
There are 3 \"editions\" (versions) of the Checker available: the Standard release version, the Portable release version, and the Pre-release version.

The latest Standard/Portable release versions of The Checker are available here: https://github.com/JediLin/Hearing-Aids-Fitting-Software-Update-Checkers/releases/latest

NOTE: You can also get the latest Standard/Portable release version via The Checker's built-in \"*Self Update Checker*\" option.
