# Hearing Aids Fitting Software Update Checkers
## Standard vs. Portable release version
For the Standard release version, you need to have the latest version of Python installed on the system.

Portable release version contains not only all the very same script files from the Standard release, but also 32-bit Windows embeddable Python package and required modules. The Portable release version works on 32/64-bit Windows systems without needing to install Python, hence called \"Portable\" release.

The Portable release version is rather large in total files size and may have some function limitation. However, this version is suitable for who have trouble getting Python installed.

## Pre-release version
If you don't want to wait for the proper release, the fresh pre-release work-in-progress version is available here: https://github.com/JediLin/Hearing-Aids-Fitting-Software-Update-Checkers/archive/refs/heads/main.zip

NOTE: You can also get the pre-release version via The Checker's \"*Extra & Legacy Software Update Checkers*\" option.

The Pre-release version is a work-in-progress based on the Standard release. This means that you need to have the latest version of Python installed for Pre-release version to work, too; or you can replace files in Portable release to make the Pre-release package portable.
